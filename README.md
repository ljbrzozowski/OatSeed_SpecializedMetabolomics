# Oat Seed Specialized Metabolomics
Scripts for genomic, transcriptomic and eQTL analyses of specialized metabolites in oat seed. 

These scripts were used in the manuscript "Selection for seed size has uneven effects on specialized metabolite abundance in oat (Avena sativa L)" (https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkab419). Data used in these scripts is deposited in CyVerse (https://datacommons.cyverse.org/browse/iplant/home/shared/GoreLab/dataFromPubs/Brzozowski_OatMetabolome_2021).

1. GenomicHeritabilityCorrelation.R, script to calculate genomic heritability and genomic correlation of metabolites and seed phenotypes for all germplasm panels
2. GenomeWideAssocaitionStudy.R, script to conduct GWAS for metabolites and seed phenotypes for all germplasm panels
3. TranscriptomeWideAssocaitionStudy_GOEnrich.R, script to conduct TWAS for metabolites and seed phenotypes for all the diverse germplasm panel and GO enrichment 
4. eQTLAnalysis.R, script to conduct eQTL analysis
